Topic: Quantum Computing

Summary
-------
Quantum computing is a type of computation that uses quantum mechanics to solve complex problems faster than classical computers. It leverages phenomena like superposition and entanglement to perform computations in a fundamentally different way. While still in its early stages, quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize fields like medicine, materials science, finance, and artificial intelligence.
